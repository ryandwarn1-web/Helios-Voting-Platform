# Helios Portal

Helios Portal is the official entry point to the Helios Blockchain, providing users with a seamless interface for bridging, staking, delegation, governance voting, and portfolio management. This platform simplifies interactions across the Helios ecosystem while ensuring security, efficiency, and interchain connectivity.

## Features

- Cross-Chain Bridging – Move assets between Helios and external blockchains.
- Staking & Delegation – Secure the network by staking tokens and delegating to validators.
- Governance & Voting – Participate in decentralized governance decisions.
- Portfolio Management – Track assets, rewards, and governance activities.
- EVM & Cosmos Integration – Seamlessly connects with EVM wallets and Cosmos-based tools.
